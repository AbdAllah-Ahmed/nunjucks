# Templating System Documentation

For now, head over to [jinja's
documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/) for templates.
Nunjucks supports most of jinja's features, and those docs are
very good. Nunjucks will get better docs over time.

Please read ["How Nunjucks is Different from
Jinja2"](#how-nunjucks-is-different-from-jinja2) to see what features
are missing. Nunjucks is being quickly developed and will implement
missing features over time.
